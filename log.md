# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Thoughts** I've been coding for 5 years, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: November 29, 2019
##### React Framework!

**Today's Progress**: Learning React & React Native to build complex apps.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed learning the React concepts.

   1. It's a great architecture.  It's declerative properties allows for less complexity and great performance. 

   2. You build your web app like lego blocks with components (function & Classes) using JSX code.  Can't wait to utilize it.

   3. Unidirectinal data flow (virtualDOM).  One way data flow, allows for ease for finding bugs in code.

   4. UI libraries

### Day 2: November 30, 2019 
##### Learning JSX

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: December 01, 2019 
##### Learning about the life cycle methods

**Today's Progress**: Utilized the react components to fetch json data.

**Thoughts**: I learned about the methods like map() that gets call at different stages of when the component gets rendered, automatically build with react.
